- Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

## Commit messages

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification to standardize our commit history. <br> The commit message summary (or pull request title) is constructed by prepending the type of change being made (e.g., *feat*, *fix*, *refactor*), followed by an imperative, present tense sentence (without a period). Example: `fix: make header bold`. 

> Types other than *fix:* and *feat:* are allowed.
